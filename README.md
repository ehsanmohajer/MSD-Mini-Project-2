Select one topic for a group of 2-3 students:

Return your repository as an answer to the exercise by 24.11.2023 or before in Moodle.
See also if there are newer return date published in Moodle
Note! Don't make this exercise too complicated because a relatively simple implementation is enough to pass. You can do the work either alone or in pairs with another person (1-2 person / group).

Design an RESTful Web Service which you can use to make appointments/reservations in the calendar.

You can make appointments for example for a dentist, a barber or for a doctor.
Please select only one profession for this assignment.
RESTful Routes
Define routes for the service. It is extremely important to follow the standard approach in building your API. Use all HTTP methods below to define routes to your service

GET method is used to retrieve resources from a server.
POST method is used to create a new resource into the collection of resources on a server.
PUT method is used to update the existing resource on the server. It fully replaces an entire existing resource.
DELETE Method is used to delete the resources from a server
Optionally PATCH method is used to update the existing resource on the server. It partially updates an existing resource.
Mandatory routes
Some mandatory routes to define to RESTful service in this task are:

to get all the reservations from the calendar
to add new reservation to your calendar
to update existing reservation in the calendar
to remove the reservation or multiple reservations from the calendar
To search the reservations by using different search criteria

based on service provided by the customer
based on customer name
based on the time period
